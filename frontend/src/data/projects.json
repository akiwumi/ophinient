    "synopsis": "Set against the backdrop of the 1960s Mediterranean, The Last Horizon tells the story of Captain Alistair Drake, a man haunted by a catastrophic decision made decades ago. When a mysterious letter arrives from a port he thought lost to time, he embarks on one final journey aboard the vessel that defined his life. Along the way, he encounters old allies, dangerous rivals, and a young stowaway who forces him to reckon with the legacy he'll leave behind. A meditation on guilt, redemption, and the sea's indifference to both.",
